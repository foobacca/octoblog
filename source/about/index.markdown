I am Hamish Downer, a wookie programmer and sys admin, hence foobacca.

## Coding

## Writing

As well as [this blog](/) I used to blog on [wordpress](http://wookielove.wordpress.com) and have written a number of [blog posts for Aptivate](http://aptivate.org/en/blog/author/hamish/).  And in the days before blogs (1998-99) I spent a year [travelling across Asia, writing emails as I went](/asia.html).

I've also written plenty of technical content on 
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3189/hamish-downer), 
[askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/users/150/hamish-downer) and 
[other stack exchange sites](https://stackexchange.com/users/2297/hamish-downer).

## Talking

I have given a few conference talks including: 

* [reducing page sizes with Django](https://github.com/foobacca/reduce-django-page-size) - PyConUK 2013
* [OOD Rules](https://github.com/foobacca/ood-rules) (object oriented design rules) - PyConUK 2013

I also often [take notes at conferences](https://foobacca.github.io/foobacca-event-notes/).
