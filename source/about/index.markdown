I am Hamish Downer, a wookie programmer and sys admin, hence foobacca.

## Coding

I can be found on <a href="https://github.com/foobacca" rel="me">github</a> (and an older account on <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mishd" rel="me">launchpad</a>).  Open source code I've worked on professionally that I'm proud of includes:

* [trademapper](https://github.com/trademapper/trademapper-js) - built to map the trade in endangered species
* [API](https://github.com/oriel-hub/api) for a content hub for IDS
* [dye](https://github.com/aptivate/dye) (Deploy Your Environment) - a set of script for deploying Django applications, along with a project cookiecutter.  It ended up being slightly too tied to our internal project and server set up to be widely reusable, but there's some good stuff in there.

More on my own time I've been obsessed with mail clients including coding for [sup](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup) and some tools around [notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org) including [notmuch-abook](https://github.com/foobacca/notmuch-abook) and [afew](https://github.com/foobacca/afew).

## Writing

As well as [this blog](/) I used to blog on [wordpress](http://wookielove.wordpress.com) and have written a number of [blog posts for Aptivate](http://aptivate.org/en/blog/author/hamish/).  And in the days before blogs (1998-99) I spent a year [travelling across Asia, writing emails as I went](/asia.html).

I've also written plenty of technical content on 
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3189/hamish-downer), 
[askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/users/150/hamish-downer) and 
[other stack exchange sites](https://stackexchange.com/users/2297/hamish-downer).

## Talking

I have given a few conference talks including: 

* [reducing page sizes with Django](https://github.com/foobacca/reduce-django-page-size) - PyConUK 2013
* [OOD Rules](https://github.com/foobacca/ood-rules) (object oriented design rules) - PyConUK 2015

I also often [take notes at conferences](https://foobacca.github.io/foobacca-event-notes/).

## Socialising

In the virtual world I can be found on:

* <a href="https://twitter.com/hgd20" rel="me">twitter</a>
* <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102616221256017791739/posts" rel="me">google plus</a>

In the real world I can often be found [dancing the lindy hop](http://www.cambridgelindy.com/) or helping run [day retreats in the insight tradition](https://cambridgedayretreats.wordpress.com/).
