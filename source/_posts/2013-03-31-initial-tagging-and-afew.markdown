*This post is part of my [notmuch of a journey series](/blog/2013/03/notmuch/)*.

I love the way gmail uses labels and I loved using them in sup.  notmuch has tags for the same purpose so I want to use them extensively, and to have most tags added automatically for me.

## The notmuch new mail workflow

** initial tagging - standard notmuch, set up new tags

## afew

** afew set up
** finding config files on github
** adding afew as post-new hook

** adding RegexFilter - or to a separate blog post?
