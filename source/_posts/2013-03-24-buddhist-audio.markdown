Here are some sources of buddhist audio:

- [london insight](http://www.dharmaseed.org/talks/) (recordings of teachers who John Teesdale also brings to Cambridge) 
- [audio dharma](http://www.audiodharma.org/talks/) (US centre) 
- [free buddhist audio](http://www.freebuddhistaudio.com/audio/) (Triratna, aka FWBO) 
- [buddhist geeks](http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/) (I used them last Wednesday) 
- [dharma seed](http://www.dharmaseed.org/talks/)
